# Problem Solving II : Enumerating Permutations

Code available here    
[https://github.com/cpro-iiit/cpro-iiit.github.io/tree/main/web/content/docs/course_material/lectures/33/perm)](https://github.com/cpro-iiit/cpro-iiit.github.io/tree/main/web/content/docs/course_material/lectures/33/perm).

## Home Work

- Take alphabet set (for eg a b c ) and a number k as input, and print all strings of length k, which takes letters from that alphabet (if the alphabet is a b c, there are 3^k of them). Print them in lexicographic order

- Given n,k, enumerate all substes of {1,2, .., n} of size k. Print them in lexicogrphaic order.

- Given n, k, enumerate all arrangements of k numbers from {1,2, .. n}. Print them in lexicographic order.
